# Note: 
# Why path[:]?
# Lists in Python are mutable, so when you do path.append(root.data), it modifies the same list object across recursive calls.
# When you append path to result (result.append(path)), you're appending a reference to the same list.
# Further recursive calls modify path, which also affects the already stored references in result. 

# Why path.pop()?
# Since path is a mutable list, all recursive calls modify the same list reference. Without pop(), elements from one recursive call would incorrectly persist in other calls.
# By using path.pop(), we ensure that:
# We remove the last node from the path when returning from a recursive call.
# This way, when we move to another branch, the path remains correct.

# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer
# https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/

# Intuition:
# The challenge is that we need to copy nodes that have both next and random pointers,
# where random can point to any node in the list (or None). We can't set the random
# pointers during the first pass because the target nodes might not exist yet. 

# Solution: Two-pass approach with a hashmap. First pass creates all new nodes and
# maps oldâ†’new. Second pass sets up all the pointers using the mapping. The key
# insight is initializing the map with {None: None} to handle edge cases cleanly.

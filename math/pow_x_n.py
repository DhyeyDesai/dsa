# 50. Pow(x, n)
# https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/

"""
Solution 1 Intuition (Recursive - Exponentiation by Squaring):
The key insight is that x^n can be computed efficiently using the property:
- If n is even: x^n = (x^2)^(n/2)
- If n is odd: x^n = x * (x^2)^(n/2)

This reduces the problem size by half each time, achieving O(log n) complexity.
For negative exponents, we compute x^|n| and take the reciprocal.

"""
Solution 2 Intuition (Iterative - Binary Exponentiation):
Same mathematical principle but implemented iteratively using bit manipulation.
We build the result by examining each bit of the exponent from right to left.
For each bit position, we decide whether to include the current power of x.

Think of n in binary: if n = 13 = 1101â‚‚, then x^13 = x^8 * x^4 * x^1
